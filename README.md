# name_and_address
Introduction to variable input and f string application
Written code asks for input from the user about their name and address. The given input is stored and presented to the user with an f-string.

This code documents my progression to understanding how to use Python. It does not actually collect user data but displays that I understand basic f-string, print, and input statements.
